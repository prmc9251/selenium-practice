What is Selenium?

Open-source suite for automating web browsers (web UI testing).
Provides language bindings (Java, Python, C#, Ruby, JS, PHP, etc.) and browser drivers.
Not for native desktop apps or native mobile apps (web-only automation).

Where Selenium fits (comparison with other tools)

Web (browser) applications: Selenium (widely used in industry).
Desktop apps: tools like QTP/UFT (commercial; VBScript-based historically).
Mobile apps (native/hybrid): Appium, Robotium, Calabash.
API / Web services (REST / SOAP): Postman, SoapUI, Rest Assured.
Database testing: SQL clients, DB-specific tools, or data frameworks (MySQL, Hadoop ecosystems).

Selenium features / capabilities

Multi-browser support: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, Opera, etc.
Multi-language bindings: Java (.jar), C# (.dll), Ruby (gem), Python (package), JavaScript, PHP.
Cross-platform: Windows, macOS, Linux (runs in CI, containers, cloud providers).
Integrates with test frameworks, CI, reporting, and visual/CDP tooling.

Selenium components (modern view)

Selenium WebDriver: primary API to control browsers via W3C WebDriver protocol.
Selenium IDE: browser extension for record-and-playback (quick prototypes).
Selenium Grid: distribute/parallelize test execution across machines or cloud nodes.
Selenium Manager: automates browser-driver discovery and management.

Selenium history / evolution (concise)

Selenium 1: IDE + RC (RC is deprecated).
Selenium 2: introduced WebDriver (replaced RC as primary API).
Selenium 3: matured WebDriver; transitioned toward W3C compatibility.
Selenium 4 (current major line): full W3C WebDriver compliance, Grid rework, Selenium Manager, improved CDP/BiDi support.

What is an API? (short)

API = Application Programming Interface: a set of methods/commands a library exposes so your code can interact with it (e.g., WebDriver methods: get(), find_element(), click()).

Limitations — what Selenium does NOT cover

Cannot solve CAPTCHAs or handle real OTPs by design.
Not for native mobile apps (use Appium instead).
No built-in advanced reporting or visual-regression; integrate external tools.
Tests can be brittle without robust locators and proper waiting strategies.

Common tech stack when using Selenium (Java-centered example)

Language & runtime: Core Java (or Python, C#, etc.)
IDE: IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse / VS Code
Build tools: Maven / Gradle / Ant
Test frameworks: JUnit / TestNG (or pytest / Mocha)
Reporting: ExtentReports, Allure, or similar
BDD: Cucumber (optional)
CI/CD: Jenkins / GitHub Actions / GitLab CI / others
Containerization / scaling: Docker, Kubernetes; cloud grids like BrowserStack, Sauce Labs
